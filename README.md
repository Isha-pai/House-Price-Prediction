# House_Prediction
Predicting housing prices is a critical task in real estate and urban planning. This project explores the use of
machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging Apache Sparkâ€™s capabilities, to predict housing prices based on
various features from a dataset. The dataset used includes geographic and socioeconomic factors such as location
coordinates, housing age, population density, and median income.
